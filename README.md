#### By converting the frames of a GIF into corresponding ASCII characters based on pixel brightness, this project creates a dynamic and visually appealing text-based animation, using the p5.js library. It highlights key programming concepts such as image processing, frame control, and basic HTML content manipulation.
Each pixel's brightness is mapped to a character in a predefined density string, which consists of characters ordered by their perceived brightness, from the darkest (Ã‘) to the lightest (.). This mapping creates a visual effect where darker pixels are represented by darker characters and lighter pixels by lighter characters.
####
The project uses a frame counter and a delay mechanism to control the speed of the animation. This ensures that the GIF does not play too quickly, allowing viewers to appreciate the ASCII art transformation.
